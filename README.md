# **Sleep Disorder Prediction**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project predicts **sleep disorders** (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea) using **machine learning models** based on **lifestyle and medical factors** such as age, BMI, sleep duration, blood pressure, and stress levels.  

## **📊 Dataset**  
- **400 records** with **13 features** covering:  
  - Sleep metrics (duration, quality)  
  - Lifestyle factors (physical activity, stress, BMI)  
  - Health indicators (blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps)  
  - Sleep disorders (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea)  

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Decision Tree Classifier (87% accuracy)  
  - Random Forest Classifier (89% accuracy)  

## **🔍 Key Features**  
✔ Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
✔ Sleep disorder classification using ML models  
✔ Model performance evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  

## **📈 Results & Insights**  
- **Gender Impact:** Males have more Insomnia, females more Sleep Apnea.  
- **Occupation Influence:** Nurses and Salespersons are at higher risk.  
- **BMI & Sleep Disorders:** Obese and overweight individuals are more affected.  

## **🚀 How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sleep-disorder-prediction.git
   cd sleep-disorder-prediction
   ```    
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  

## **📜 Conclusion**  
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (**89%**), and insights show that **occupation, gender, and BMI** are significant factors in sleep disorders.
